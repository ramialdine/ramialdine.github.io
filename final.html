   <h2> Hello, and welcome to my final project page!</h2>


   <p> My partners and I developed an air hockey game using the tools and knowledge we acquired during our CSC 106 class at URI. 
     This game includes a screen to customize your paddle, a scoreboard, and collision physics (that work most of the time)! To start,
      go into the "about" section in Kahn Academy under our game. There will be a button that says "settings", click this button and change the
      ratio to 600 by 600 in order for you to properly view the game.
   <br> You begin the game by pressing the start button. The puck has an easier time making contact with the paddle if you go slower. 
      Hit the puck into your opponents goal to score and have fun!
   </p>
